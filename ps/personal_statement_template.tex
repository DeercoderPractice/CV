I am writing to apply for a SIAM student travel award to attend the SIAM
conference on Applications of Dynamical Systems. 
I am submitting a poster on the data assimilation research that I have been
doing for the past year with the help of my advisor Dr. Elaine Spiller
% My poster is 
titled `Assimilation of Lagrangian Ocean Glider Data.' 
It presents
techniques for using Lagrangian data from simulated ocean drifters to estimate
initial conditions and parameters for nonlinear models of the fluid flows which
move the drifter.

I am very excited at the prospect of sharing my work with the community, but
more than that I am excited to learn from the research of other lecturers
presenting at the conference. 
My research interest lies in data assimilation of dynamical systems which I
know is an interest shared by some of the community attending the conference,
and it will be an amazing opportunity for me to hear about their work and gain
some insight into the challenges that similar researchers have faced. 

During my undergraduate years and first years as a graduate student, I attended
a couple Computer Science conferences and even presented at one.
They were both great experiences in which I learned a lot, but none of the
topics I encountered were related to the mathematical research I am
interested in and currently working on.
I can only imagine how much I will learn by attending a conference focused on
my own research interests!

I am truly looking forward to the possibility of attending this conference,
and the travel award will go a long way towards making that happen.
Thank you so much for your consideration of my application.
